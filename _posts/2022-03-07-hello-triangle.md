title: Hello Triangle
---

I had an idea to make a triangle calculator. So you could input some information about angles and side lengths and then the
computer can work out the rest. I got a bit carried away making an interactive drawing of a triangle instead.

<div id="trianglegeometry"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/js/p5.js" ></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/js/trianglegeometry_instancemode.js" ></script>
<br />
